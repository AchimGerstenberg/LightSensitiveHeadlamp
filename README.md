# LightSensitiveHeadlamp

Imagine you are skiing in the night. <br>1. You look down into the snow <br>2. You are blinded <br>3. You look up and see nothing <br>4. You want to change the brightness but your gloves are too thick for the knob <br>Here is a solution!

Or not, I can only find a very early version with the accelerometer user input and the CAD drawings of the later modular version for the magnetically attachable LED module.

The idea is to use a photoresistor to measure the light intensity that shines towards the headlamp and decrease brightness when the photoresitor measures a high light intensity. If the measured light is reflected light then the headlamp is programmed to keep the reflected light intensity constant. This is useful when looking down into the snow or on a map (orienteering).

The brightness of the headlamp can be adjusted by hitting the accelerometer on the backhead and then tilting the head left or right.
